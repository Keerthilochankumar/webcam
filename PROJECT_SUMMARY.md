# Camera Privacy Manager - Project Summary

## Overview
A comprehensive camera privacy management system built in Python that provides secure control over webcam access with authentication, activity logging, and intrusion detection capabilities.

## ✅ Completed Features

### Core Functionality
- **Password-Protected Camera Control**: Enable/disable camera with secure authentication
- **System-Wide Camera Blocking**: Administrative-level camera blocking that prevents ALL applications from accessing the camera
- **Intrusion Detection**: Automatic capture of 10-second videos/photos when wrong passwords are entered
- **Activity Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all camera operations and security events
- **Email Notifications**: Automatic email alerts for security incidents with evidence attachments

### Security Features
- **Administrative Privileges**: Requires and verifies Windows administrator rights for system-level control
- **Password Security**: SHA-256 hashing with random salts, password strength validation
- **Silent Evidence Capture**: Intrusion attempts recorded without alerting the intruder
- **Multiple Attempt Detection**: Identifies patterns of repeated failed authentication attempts
- **Secure Database Storage**: SQLite database with prepared statements to prevent SQL injection

### User Interface
- **Intuitive GUI**: Clean tkinter-based interface with four main functions
- **Initial Setup Wizard**: First-time user setup for password creation
- **Logs Viewer**: Comprehensive log display with filtering and export capabilities
- **Settings Window**: Email configuration, security settings, and system maintenance
- **Status Indicators**: Real-time camera status display (Active/Blocked)

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Windows operating system
- Administrator privileges (required for system-wide camera blocking)

### Installation
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the application as Administrator:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### First-Time Setup
1. The application will detect it's the first run and show a setup wizard
2. Create an administrator username and password
3. Configure email notifications (optional)
4. Start using the camera privacy features

## 🔧 Usage

### Main Functions
- **View Logs**: Password-protected access to detailed activity logs
- **Check Status**: Instantly see if camera is Active or Blocked
- **Enable Camera**: Authenticate and enable camera access
- **Disable Camera**: Authenticate and block camera system-wide

### Settings
- **Email Configuration**: Set up SMTP for security alerts
- **Security Settings**: Configure intrusion detection parameters
- **System Maintenance**: Cleanup old evidence files

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Administrative Camera Control
- Uses Windows registry modifications to disable camera at driver level
- Fallback to PowerShell Device Manager commands
- Prevents ANY application from accessing camera when disabled

### Intrusion Detection
- Automatic evidence capture on failed authentication
- 10-second video recording (or photo if video fails)
- Silent operation - no notification to potential intruder
- Email alerts with evidence attachments

### Data Protection
- Passwords stored as salted SHA-256 hashes
- Database uses prepared statements
- Evidence files stored in protected directory
- Comprehensive audit logging

## 🧪 Testing

### Run All Tests
```bash
python run_tests.py
```

### Run Specific Tests
```bash
python run_tests.py test_database_manager
```

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests for all manager classes
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- Error handling and edge case testing
- Concurrent operation testing

## 📊 Key Statistics

- **17 Tasks Completed**: All planned features implemented
- **8 Manager Classes**: Modular, well-organized architecture
